# Student Grade Tracker (Python GUI)

## Project Title:
**Student Grade Tracker**

## Programming Language:
Python 3

## Libraries Used:
- `tkinter`: For building the graphical user interface (GUI)
- `tkinter.messagebox`: To display error and status messages

All libraries are built-in and work without any installation.

## Objective:
This project allows users to input a student's name and two grades. It calculates the average of the grades and determines whether the student has **passed** (average ‚â• 50) or **failed**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:
1. The user enters:
   - Student Name
   - Grade 1
   - Grade 2
2. When the **"Calculate Result"** button is clicked:
   - The program calculates the average.
   - If the average is 50 or above ‚Üí **Passed**  
     Else ‚Üí **Failed**
   - Displays the results in a formatted label.
3. If invalid (non-numeric) input is entered, a popup error is shown.

## Example Output:
Student: Alice
Average: 63.50
Status: Passed

## Features:
- Simple and intuitive GUI
- Real-time result calculation
- Input validation and error handling
- Uses only standard Python libraries

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the practical use of:
- GUI creation using `tkinter`
- Basic input/output logic
- Conditionals and error handling in Python

You can run this project on **any machine** with Python 3 installed ‚Äî no external libraries are required.
